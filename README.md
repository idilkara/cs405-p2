cs405 project 2 

# This is the github repository for CS405 project 2

# This repository contains:
    project2.html and project2.js and obj.js files and some resources for textures and object models in the resources folder.

# The project consists of 4 tasks:

## Task 1:
Allow any sized images as input for texture. 

    Steps to try: 
    1. Choose file for the "Obj Model": sphere.obj or cube.obj
    2. Choose file for the "Texture image": leaves.jpg 

## Task 2:
Implement ambient light and diffuse light.
Make the light source position adjustable via arrow keys.
Make the light density adjustible via slider. 

    Steps to try: 
    1. Choose file for the "Obj Model": sphere.obj or cube.obj
    2. Choose file for the "Texture image": leaves.jpg or nyra.png or bricks.png
    3. Check the "Enable Light" option.
    4. Adjust the "Ambient Light Density".
    5. Adjust the light position using arrow keys.

    

## Task 3: 
Implement specular light, adjustable through a slider.

    Steps to try: 
    1. Choose file for the "Obj Model": sphere.obj or cube.obj
    2. Choose file for the "Texture image": leaves.jpg or nyra.png or bricks.png
    3. Check the "Enable Light" option.
    4. Adjust the "Specular Light Intensity".
    5. Adjust the light position using arrow keys.

    Note: This task is implemented upon task 2 so the ambient light is also effective and the slider for "Ambient Light Density" still adjusts the ambient light density.

## Task 4: 
Enable support for multiple textures per object 

    Steps to try: 
    1. Choose file for the "Obj Model": sphere.obj or cube.obj
    2. Choose file for the "Texture image": leaves.jpg or nyra.png or bricks.png
    3. Choose another file for the "Second Texture image": leaves.jpg or nyra.png or bricks.png
    4. Adjust the "Texture Spectrum".

    Note: This task is implemented upon task 2 and 3 so the options for tasks 2 and 3 also work similarly.
